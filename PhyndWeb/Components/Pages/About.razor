    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p class="lead">If you're wondering, "phÿnd" is supposed to be pronounced like "fiend".</p>
    <p>
        phÿnd is a machine-learning (in the loosest sense of the term) application that plays tic-tac-toe. phÿnd knows nothing about
        the game in terms of strategy; it only knows which moves it has made and whether that move led to a loss. phÿnd initially
        chooses a spot to place its cross at random, leading to some embarassing losses. However, as phÿnd loses, it becomes
        progressively less likely to make those same decisions that led to a loss. It's a very inefficient system as a whole
        and the implementation could have been improved by accounting for matching translated scenarios, but I think it's still
        a good bit of fun in the end.

        phÿnd is based off of concepts in Menace, the machine-educable naughts-and-crosses engine. The two have a similar premise
        but menace is physically built on bead in matchboxes. Standupmaths has an excellent video on the project that you can
        see here.
